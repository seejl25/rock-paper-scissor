# rock-paper-scissor
Created a rock-paper-scissors game project by TheOdinProject
- 3 buttons were made for users to choose between rock, paper scissors.
- Once the choice is made, it will be compared with the computer choice which is randomised. 
- The scores will be updated accordingly and the one that reaches five points first wins!
- First attempt at creating a project using Javascript after learning the foundations
- UI done using HTML and CSS
